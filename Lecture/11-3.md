### How is glucose regulated?

* the amount of insulin released in the blood is proportionate to the amount of carbohydrates we consume
* glycemic index (GI): a measure of how fast blood sugar rises after eating a specific food
  * initially introduced to diabetic patients
  * turns out, it's a bit biased and misleading
    * for example, white rice scores 89 (this is high!) on the GI
    * doesn't specify quantity
* glycemic load (GL): function of the glycemic index as it relates to the quantity of food
  * a serving of white rice (150g) contains 52g of carbohydrates
  * 52g of carbohydrates * 89/100 GI score = 46 GL score
  * low <10
  * med 10-20
  * high >20
* sugar that is absorbed quickly is bad because it raises insulin levels
* fruits have medium glycemic load but contain lots of fiber so they still slow down digestion
* foods with fiber give less calories than is displayed on the label because fiber can't fully be digested by the body
* whole wheat means natural and contain fiber
* there are very few naturally occurring foods that contain only protein 

### Proteins

* 1g = 4 Cal
* extremely essential
* rarely used for energy, the cells get energy mainly from carbohydrates and lipids
* individual molecules are called amino acids
* total of 20 different amino acids
* amino acids have a structure of carbon connected to hydrogen, carboxyl, amino, and a variable group (R-group: determines the function of the amino acid)
* there are 9 essential and 11 non-essential amino acids
