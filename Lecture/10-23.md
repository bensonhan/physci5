* solid at room temperature because chemical structure is linear which allows the molecules to stack
* stored to be used as energy

### Unsaturated fats

* liquid at room temperature because there are kinks, or bends in the chemical structure
* in body converted to "healthy" molecules

2. has better shape
3. unsaturated fats have shorter shelf life and cost more to manufacture

### Trans fats
