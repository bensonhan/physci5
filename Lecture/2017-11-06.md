## Amino Acids
* essential: body can't synthesize so need from nature
* 9 essential and 11 non-essential
* complete food: contains all 9 essential amino acids
* meat, dairy, and soy are all complete foods
* meat is usually the main source of protein, but contains a lot of fat

## Proteins as Enzymes
* cells can but don't like using protein as a source of energy (ATP) because there are more important functions
* chemical facilitators
* chemical reaction
  * reactants -> products
  * amylase converts starch -> glucose

## Proteins as Hormones and Receptors
* insulin, growth hormone, TSH
* hormones are made of proteins
* receptor: place where the cell receives hormones

## Proteins for Tissue Balance
* maintains fluid balance
* 60-70% of the body is water, it is found in...
  * cells
  * blood (which is 90% water!)
  * interstitial (extracellular) fluid: fluid that surrounds cells
* if there's too much water, the cells are prone to burst
* if there isn't enough water, the cells will shrivel
* when working out (or other high metabolism activity) there is an excess of water pumped into the cells and interstitial fluid, this is the reason for the "pump" when going to the gym
* edema
  * water imbalance
  * permanent cases happen during starvation
  * this is why malnourished people have big bellies, it is swelling from the water when the body resorts to using protein for energy instead of carbohydrates or fats

## Proteins for Transport Across Cells
* glut: glucose transporters
* transport materials across cells

## Proteins for Movement
* actin and myosin
*
