# muscles

* final isn't cumulative!

### types of exercise

* aerobic: high repetition, low force (ex. running)
* resistance: low repetition, high force (ex. weightlifting)
* voluntary muscles
  * muscles that can be consciously moved
  * skeletal muscles are voluntary
  * there are over 700 voluntary muscles in the body

### muscle structure

* fascicles: bundles of fiber that make up a muscle
* myofibrils: hair-like protein structures that make up a fascicles
* sarcomere: functional units of myofibril

### contraction

* functional units
  * interaction between actin and myosin that enable the production of force
  * the contraction produces forces
* types of contraction
  * concentric: against the direction of gravity
  * eccentric: with the direction of gravity
  * when weightlifting, try to do concentric actions quickly and eccentric actions slowly
