### Liver

* fibers
  *  "false" calories: 1g != 4 Cal as written on the food label, it varies from person to person
  * enzymes in our body are unable to break down fibers
  * the bacteria and micro-organisms in our body digest and consume the fibers, a small amount is absorbed by our bodies
  * feel "full" when eating fiber
  * soluble
    * oats/pulp
    * slows absorption, this is good for hunger signaling because it takes longer to feel hungry again
    * traps cholesterol in digestive organs, patients with CVD benefit from increased fiber consumption
    * fiber softens feces reducing friction against the large intestine
    * individuals who start eating fiber pass more gas because the byproduct of digestion of fiber by bacteria in our body is methane gas
  * insoluble
    * skin of fruits
    * decreases risk of digestive diseases
  * natural fiber is, physiologically speaking, better than artificial fiber supplements
  * sugar alcohols (sorbitol, xylitol) does not count as sugar but is still sweet, this is how companies advertise sugar-free

### How is glucose regulated?

* recommended sugar level: 70-100 mg/dL
* increases after a meal and decreases in between meals
* hormones work to maintain homeostasis
  * insulin 
    * works to lower sugar levels
    * released from pancreas when sugar levels are high in the blood
    * delivers sugar to the liver and the muscles
      * the pool of sugar in the liver is for the entire body
      * sugar in muscles are for muscles only
  * glucagon raises the concentration of sugar and fat in the body
  * insulin and glucagon regulate flow of sugar in and out of the liver
  * do not want: insulin spikes
    * caused by large meals
    * eat food that gets digested slowly to reduce spikes
    * insulin usually promotes satiation but decreases satiation when there's a spike
