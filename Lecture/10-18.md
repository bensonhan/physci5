# Week 3 Wednesday - Lecture Notes

#### The Thyroid Gland

* Thyroid hormone increases..
  * Metabolism
  * BMR (basil metabolic rate)
  * Oxygen consumption
  * Heat production, this is a side effect of energy (ATP) production
  * Gluconeogenesis - the generation of glucose for energy
  * Lipolysis
  * Fatty acid production
  * Growth hormones
* Abbreviated T3/T4
* Hyper- vs Hypothyroidism
  * Produces much more or less of the Thyroid hormone
  * Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism
    * Prone to be skinny
    * Always warm
    * Bulgy eyes
  * Symptoms of Hypothyroidism
    * Prone to obesity
    * Always cold

#### Corticotrophs

* Cortisol is released from the Adrenal Cortex
* Regulates stress by making nutrients available, releases/breaks down...
  * Lipids through lipolysis in the adipose tissue
  * Glucose through gluconeogenesis in the liver
  * Protein in the muscles only when Cortisol levels are high (SO DON'T STRESS OUT!!)

#### Liver

* Releases lipids into blood
* Major storage
* Muscle storage
