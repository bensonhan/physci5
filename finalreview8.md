# diabetes

### intro

* body is unable to regulate blood sugar levels
* 3 types
  1. â€‹gestational
    * temporary
    * high blood sugar levels during pregnancy
  2. type 1
    * starts in children
    * autoimmune disease where the beta cells of the pancreas are destroyed
  3. type 2
    * body is unable to efficiently use insulin
    * most common
    * affects 6% of adults worldwide, 11% in the US
    * lifestyle
### insulin
* w/o insulin
  1. systematic complications
  2. body cells will be deprived of glucose
### gestational
* affects 6% of females
* associated w/ females who...
  * consume food that is/has...
    * processed
    * high glycemic load
    * low in fiber
  * are over the age of 35
  * are obese
  * are physically 
* affects children
  * higher risk of diabetes
  * might have undergo caesarian delivery
### type 1 diabetes
* immune system mistakenly attacks pancreatic beta cells
* patients must take injections
  * no standard dosage
### type 2 diabetes
* pre-diabetic state - patients have insulin resistance
* pancreas still functions but cells don't respond to insulin
* most patients find out they are pre-diabetic from routine blood work rather than from symptoms
* insulin resistance (in pre-diabetics) is reversible if patients engage in exercise and healthy habits
* complications
  * high amounts of fatty acids and triglycerides
  * fatty liver disease
    * excess fat accumulation in the liver
  * hypoglycemia
    * low levels of glucose in the blood
    * side effect of diabetes treatment when patients take a high amount of insulin
    * symptoms include sweating, nervousness, mood changes, and shakiness
  * ketoacidosis
    * fatty acids in the liver get converted into ketones
    * ketone bodies can be taken to the brain to be modified into ATP
    * diabetics have abnormally high levels of ketone bodies causing a decrease in the blood pH 
    * can cause massive water loss as changes in acidity affect protein shape and functionality
  * nephropathy
    * causes kidney failure
    * lose proteins (albumin) and glucose in the urine due to inefficient filtration
    * causes swelling
  * neuropathy
    * major damage to blood vessels and proteins in circulation
  * retinopathy
    * causes blindness
    * microvascular disease because starts w/ small blood vessels
    * diabetes is the leading cause of blindness
  * cvd's
    * increased risk of developing atherosclerosis and hypertension
    * high levels of triglycerides and cholesterol in the circulation
  * damaged red blood cells
    * hemoglobin - major protein in red blood cells whose main function is to bind to and bring oxygen to the body cells
    * in diabetic patients glucose molecules bind to hemoglobin much more frequently
    * hemoglobin bound to glucose is non-functional and called HbA1c
### diagnosing diabetes
* glucose tolerance test (GTT/OGTT)
* glucose is given orally and then blood samples are taken every 30 minutes for a period
* glucose levels should rise and fall back to normal within 2 hours
### blood lab work and OGTT
* healthy
  * fasting <100 mg/dl
  * eating <140 mg/dl
* pre-diabetic
  * fasting 100-125 mg/dl
  * eating 140-199 mg/dl
* diabetic
  * fasting >126 mg/dl
  * eating >200 mg/dl
* HbA1c test
  * measures glycosylated hemoglobin percentage
  * pre-diabetic 5.7-6.4%
  * diabetic >6.5%
### medications
* type 1
  * insulin injections 2-3 times a day
* type 2
  * sulfonylureas stimulate the beta cells of the pancreas to release more insulin, major side effect is weight gain
  * biguanides reduce glucose output from the liver and increase sensitivity to insulin
  * after 10 years, pancreas cannot be stimulated enough and insulin shots must be taken
  *
