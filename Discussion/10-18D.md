# Week 3 - Discussion Notes

#### Blood flow through heart

* Body receives oxygenated blood from the left ventricle
* Heart receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the vena cava (vein) into the right atrium
* Blood flows through right ventricle to the pulmonary artery and the lungs
* Oxygenated blood flows from lungs through the pulmonary vein to the left atrium
* Flows from the left atrium to the left ventricle to the aorta (artery)

#### Sys- and Diastole

* 2/Systole - contact-pump
* 2/Diastole - refill

#### Pacemaker cells

* brain stimulates pacemaker cells through electrical signals


* SA (sinoatrial) nodes are involved with stimulating Atria, 
  * It is the natural pacemaker, it moves the rest follow
  * Sends signals across atria
* Involved with stimulating ventricles
  * AV (atrioventricular) node distributes signal to PF
  * BH (bundle of HIS) in the middle of the sides of the heart
  * PF (Purkinje fibers) on the outside of the heart, does most of the contraction
  * AV --> BH --> PF
* Atria and ventricle alternate but the right and left sides of the heart are synchronized

#### EKG (Electrocardiogram) graph

* p - atrial contraction
* r - QRS: ventricular contraction/atrial relaxation
* t-wave - ventricular relaxation
