## Pathway of Air
* mouth/nose -> trachea -> bronchi -> bronchioles -> alveoli
* all of these are made of cartilage except for alveoli
* alveoli is where oxygen and co2 exchange occurs (capillary)
  * made of thin membrane to allow exchange so that oxygen can transport into blood and co2 fuse out of the blood
  * alveoli must be able to maintain elasticity, smoking causes alveoli to stick
## Inhalation/Exhalation
* thoracic
  * lower pressure/increase volume during inhalation
  * increase pressure/decrease volume during exhalation
* abdominal
* 1 atmosphere
* important to have strong muscles for proper breathing
* rib muscles
* in
  * diaphragm contract
  * external intercostal
* out
  * diaphragm relax
  * internal intercostal
## Spirometry
* find tidal volume
  * difference between high and low parameters
  * 0.4 - 0.7 L is normal
* for deep inhalation/exhalation
  * go beyond high parameter
  * difference between highest high and previous high is IRV (inspiratory reserve volume)
  * difference between lowest low to previous low is ERV (expiratory reserve volume)
  * sum of IRV, ERV, and tidal volume is VC (vital capacity), or the complete lung capacity
  * divide measured VC / expected VC and you get percentage VC
  * expected VC depends on age, height, and gender
    * M: (0.052H-0.022A)-3.6
    * F: (0.041H-0.018A)-2.69
    * my expected: 5.07352
    * reasons to get <80%
      * clogged airways
      * not elastic alveoli
      * weak muscles
      * experimental error
        * stand up straight
        * pinch nose
        * keep inhaling/exhaling until you can't inhale anymore
        * 5s after deep inhalation/exhalation returns to tidal
        * tidal/excess/tidal
        * M marker to measure
  * spirometer/pneumotachometer
  * data
    * td: 1.137
    * irv: 1.548
    * erv: 2.114
