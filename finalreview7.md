# heart

### the heart

* pumps 7000 liters of blood
* contracts 2.5 billion times in our lifetime
* adult heart
  * 14 cm long and 9 cm wide
  * located in the middle of the thoracic cavity and bordered by two lungs
  * divided into 4 hollow chambers
    * upper 2 chambers: right and left atrium
    * right and left ventricles are the pumping chambers
  * septum: thin wall that separates the right and left atrium and ventricles
  * valves: connective tissue that separates the atria and the ventricles
* blood flow through the heart
  * superior and inferior vena cava delivers deoxygenated blood to the right atrium
  * tricuspid valve allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle
  * right ventricle contracts to push blood through the pulmonary valve to the lungs to be oxygenated
  * the pulmonary veins return the blood to the left atrium
  * bicuspid valve allows blood to flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle
  * the left ventricle, which has the strongest force of contraction, pushes the blood to the cells in the body
  * the blood unloads the oxygen to the cells
* blood supply to the heart
  * coronary circulation nourishes the heart w/ blood
  * right and left coronary arteries supply the right and left side of the heart
  * anastomoses: alternate pathways for blood, useful for individuals w/ coronary artery disease
* heart cycle
  * diastole: relaxation
  * systole: contraction
  * cardiac cycle: a cycle of contraction and relaxation of the chambers
  * heartbeat sound comes from closing of the valves
  * heart murmur: blood leaking from atria to the ventricle due to the valves not closing properly
* blood pressure
  * force blood exerts on the walls of the blood vessels as it passes
  * pressure recorded from the aorta is used for measurements
  * sphygmomanometer: measures blood pressure as the systolic/diastolic blood pressure
* rate and output
  * average is 70-100 bpm
  * cardiac output = heart rate * stroke volume

### blood vessels
* include arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins
* made of 3 layers of tissue
  * tunica externa: thick outer layer that provides protection and is elastic
  * tunica media
    * made of smooth muscles
    * modulates the diameter of the blood vessel
      * to decrease the flow - vasoconstriction: smooth muscles contract, decreasing the diameter
      * to increase the flow: vasodilation: opposite
    * smooth muscles respond to local factors and hormonal signals such as epinephrine
  * tunica intima: single layer of endothelial cells
  * nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator, is released from the endothelial cells

### blood
* made of 3 components: cells, water, and proteins
* carries oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and other chemicals and picks up metabolic waste products
* males have 5-6 L of blood and females 4-5
* red blood cells (erythrocytes) carry oxygen and carbon dioxide
* white blood cells function in immunity
* platelets: fragments of cells that function in clot formation
* plasma: water and proteins part of blood
* hematocrit
  * test to determine the proportion of different components in blood
  * samples are placed in a centrifuge and spun
  * different components drift down based on density
  * 42-47% rbc in blood is considered healthy

### cholesterol in the blood
* exogenous (dietary) and endogenous (synthesized in the liver)
* digested by the pancreatic enzyme holesterol esterase
* liver functions as "hub" for storage and release of cholesterol
* liver release very low density lipoprotein vesicles (VLDL) to transport cholesterol
* as lipids decrease, VLDL transforms to low density lipoprotein vesicle (LDL)
* LDL is returned the liver
* high-density lipoprotein vesicles (HDL) collect excess cholesterol
* HDL is good, LDL is bad

### atherosclerosis
* artery disease and primary cause of myocardial infarctions and strokes
* leading cause of death in western societies (50%)
* progression of disease
  * buildup of cholesterol 
  * cholesterol is oxidized by reactive oxygen species
  * inflammation and recruitment of immune cells
  * blood flow starts to diminish
  * vital organs start to scar (ischemia)
  * thrombus formation occurs leading to heart attack or stroke
* lesion
  * high fat diets lead to increased circulation of cholesterol
  * LDL permeates through the endothelial cells building up between the tunica intima and the tunica media
  * HDL works to minimize LDL
* inflammation
* foam-cell formation
  * macrophages arrive to clear trapped lipid
  * endocytosis: process by which macrophages bind and engulf LDL in the sub-endothelial space
  * foam cells: macrophages fat w/ LDL, are foamy and yellowish in appearance
* fibrous plaques formation
  * plaques
    * lipid filled mass combined with migrating smooth muscle cells
    * macrophages and leukocytes release more cytokines, promoting the formation of plaques
    * fibers and calcium are deposited to ensure stability, hardening the fatty deposits and causing the blood vessels to lose flexibility
  * stenosis
    * blood vessel occlusion
    * 60% occlusion = 40% blood flow
* clinical event
  * heart attack occurs when...
    1. scar tissue and dead cells represent a large part of the heart
    2. plaque is being washed out in circulation, reaches a narrow blood vessel and completely blocks it
### diagnostic of atherosclerosis
* angiogram
  * imaging of the heart and blood vessels
  * can assess the size of the plaque and the percentage of stenosis

### angioplasty
* technique to widen the blood vessels at occlusions sites
* collapsed balloon is inserted along w/ stent, which is coated w/ drugs and anticoagulants to slowly dissolve fats and the clot

### coronary artery bypass graft
* arteries and veins from other parts of the body are taken and used so blood can "bypass" the area of the occlusion
* most commonly taken from the internal thoracic artery (chest), the radial artery (arm), and the greater saphenous vein (leg)
