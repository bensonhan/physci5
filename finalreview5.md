## chapter 5 should we stay away from sugars

### introduction

* essential bc must be obtained from diet
* exist as glucose (in the body) and glycogen (in the liver and muscles)
* primary source of energy
* each gram yields 4 calories
* nervous system favors the use of glucose
* red blood cells can only use glucose as a source of energy

### where do carbs come from

* chloroplasts are found in the photosynthetic part of plants
* opening in leaves called stomata facilitate the intake of carbon dioxide
* plants produce carbs in the form of starch and fibers

### monosaccharides

* monomers/monosaccharides are glucose, fructose, and galactose
* in food, carbs rarely exist as monomers

### disaccharides

* three disaccharides found in food are sucrose, lactose, and maltose
* sucrose is made of one glucose and one fructose and is found in fruits, vegetables, honey, sugar beets, sugar cane, and maple syrup
* lactose is made of one glucose and one galactose and is found mainly in milk
* maltose is made of two glucose, is produced by fermentation, is used in alcoholic beverages, and is rarely found in natural foods

### polysaccharides

* three polysaccharides are starch, glycogen, and fiber
* starch 
  * found in many plant products such as grains, legumes, and tuber
  * exists structurally as straight chains as amylose or branched chains as amylopectin
  * amylose, being a straight chain, takes longer to be digested
  * amylopectin interacts quicker with gut digestive enzymes
* glycogen is the most common form of stored sugar in humans
* fiber
  * polymer of glucose
  * found in grains, legumes, seeds, fruits, and vegetables
  * can't be digested by humans
  * three types of fibers are functional, dietary, and total
  * why starches are digestible and fiber is not
    * alpha glucose structure in starch creates a helical shape
    * beta glucose structure in fibers create a linear shape
    * enzymes in our body can recognize and breakdown alpha glucose but not beta
  * functional fibers have many health benefits and include psyllium, pectin, and plant gums
  * dietary fibers are found in oats and wheat, cellulose, and fruits and vegetables
  * total fiber is the sum
  * soluble and insoluble 
    * soluble fibers slow the absorption of glucose and bind to cholesterol
      * recommended for diabetic patients and those at risk of cvd's
      * lower plasma cholesterol
      * found in oats, barley, fruit pulp, dried beans, and psyllium
    * insoluble fibers
      * prevent constipation due to abrasion with the walls of the large intestine
      * found in what bran, legumes, the coating of seeds, and the skin of fruits and vegetables

### sugar alcohols 

* products of monosaccharides and disaccharides
* most common are glycerol, sorbitol, mannitol, and xylitol
* glycerol is found in triglycerides, the most common type of fat
* glycerol can be made into glucose through gluconeogenesis

### carbs in food

* simple sugars include mono- and disaccharides
* starches are complex carbohydrates

### glucose regulation in the body

* insulin and glucagon are antagonistic hormones from the endocrine system that maintain homeostasis
* insulin
  * lower plasma glucose levels
  * released in hyperglycemic conditions
  * from beta cells of the pancreas
* glucagon
  * raise plasma glucose levels
  * released in hypoglycemic conditions
  * from alpha cells of the pancreas
* glucose needs GLUTs to be transported across the plasma membrane
* insulin and glucagon regulate the amount of GLUTs

### glycemic index

* different types of carbs have different magnitudes of blood glucose level responses
* measures how quickly blood glucose level rises after consuming a food
* glycemic load takes into account the quantity of food

### carbohydrates metabolism

* mechanical digestion in the mouth
* salivary glands release amylase that helps break carbs down
* small intestine releases additional enzymes including pancreatic amylase that break down carbs into disaccharides
* glucose enters the bloodstream
* beta cells of the pancreas detect this and begin to release insulin
* liver converts glucose to glycogen with enzyme glycogen synthase
* adipose tissue 
  * stores additional glucose that cannot be stored in the muscles and liver
  * converted to fatty acid and later as triglycerides in process known as lipogenesis
