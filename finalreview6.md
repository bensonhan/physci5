# proteins

### introduction

* function in metabolism, heredity, regulation, immunity, transport, fluid balance, and kidney functions
* critical components of hormones, blood, bones, and connective tissue

### monomers

* amino acids
  * building blocks of proteins 
  * organic molecules made up of a central carbon connected to 4 other groups
    1. amino
    2. carboxyl
    3. hydrogen
    4. R
* every protein in our body is made up of 20 amino acids

### types of amino acids

* 9 essential, 11 nonessential
* transamination: process that turns essential amino acid into nonessential

### functions of proteins

* enzymes in chemical reactions
  * substrates interact to generate a particular product
  * enzymes speed up chemical reactions by increasing the affinity of substrates to one another
* hormones in signaling
* maintain fluid balance
  * interstitial fluid: water around our cells
  * important to have balanced amount of electrolytes and proteins because they affect cellular fluid movements
  * edema
    * swelling of cells due to lack of proteins causing water to exit cells into the interstitial fluid
    * observed in individuals who consume low very low energy diets
* transport
  * albumin and lipoproteins help transport water insoluble substances such as cholesterol and lipid hormones by binding to them
  * enable charged ions and energy molecules to enter/exit the cell
  * cell plasma membrane is made up of phospholipids and has limited permeability
  * motor proteins transport small vesicles within the cell
* pH balance
  * acidosis
    * too much acid in the blood
    * can change respiratory pattern
    * significant effect on digestive system
  * alkalosis: too much base in the blood
  * protiens act as buffers because of their charged amino and carboxyl groups allowing them to bind to acids and bases
* cell growth, maintenance, and repair
  * all cells constantly divide and grow except neurons
  * rbc's have a life span of 120 days
  * mitosis: cell division
* movement
  * muscles can be voluntary or involuntary
  * voluntary muscles are skeletal muscles, in our skull and face, and at the base of our lungs
  * involuntary muscles are cardiac muscles and smooth muscles
  * skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle contraction are achieved by the proteins actin and myosin
* protection
  * pathogens
    * harmful chemicals and microorganisms
    * can enter through cuts, ingestions, or inhalations
  * immune system release antibody proteins

### proteins in the diet

* meat, dairy, soy legumes, whole grains, and nuts
* meat
  * complete because contain all essential amino acids
  * but high in saturated fat and cholesterol
* soy
  * complete
  * low saturated fat and cholesterol
* beans are deficient in essential amino acid methionine
* nuts are good source but high in fat
* recommended dietary allowance of protein (RDA) is 0.8g/1kg of body weight

### digestion of proteins

* bolus: chewed food in mouth
* rugae: stomach lining that increases the surface area of the stomach
* gastric juice: various substances produced by the secretory cells in the stomach
* chief cells release pepsinogen which when activated becomes a potent enzyme that breaks down dietary proteins
* parietal cells in the stomach secrete hydrochloric acid that activates pepsinogen into pepsin
* acidity of hydrochloric acid get neutralized by the basic pH of the mucus
* chyme: broken down bolus exiting stomach
* proteolytic enzymes secreted from acinar cells in the pancreas go to the duodenum of the small intestine
* enterokinase in small intestine activates proteolytic enzymes
* aminopeptidase finishes digestion by breaking down dipeptides into amino acids

### synthesis of proteins

* ribosomes
  * protein making machinery in cells
  * found in the cell cytoplasm
* DNA is large and cannot exit cells to get into cytoplasm
* intermediary copy called RNA binds to the ribosomes
* transcription: process of translating gene into messenger RNA (mRNA) 
* translation: process of protein synthesis from mRNA
* sequences of nucleotides called codons
* four levels of protein structure
  1. primary
     *  amino acids are covalently linked
  2. secondary
     * alpha helices and beta pleated sheets
  3. tertiary
     * 3-d shape
  4. quaternary
     * interaction between proteins

### energy?

* rarely used for energy because so many other important functions!
* deamination
  * amino acid used for energy by the removal of amino group
  * nitrogen shuttled to liver and converted to toxic product called urea
* gluconeogenesis
  * amino acids converted to glucose
  * unhealthy, occurs when starving
